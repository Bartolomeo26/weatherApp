# weatherApp
Weather App based on API from OpenWeatherMap. It requires a name of the city to be passed in order to get the current weather. 
Temperature, pressure, humidity and short description of the weather are what the user will get to know after passing in a correct name of the city.
Depending on the type of the weather in the specified city - the background will change to the fitting one.
What is worth mentioning is that the application will also show the proper current date of the location. All thanks to the API from API-Ninjas and one of its features - Time Zone.

The majority of the style of the application is based on Bulma CSS framework, hence the code written in styles.css file is rather an addition to the parts where using Bulma solely, turned out to be much harder.
